name: "Image Recognition Web App"
description: >
This is a full-stack web application for image recognition that leverages AI to identify objects
and people within images. Users can either upload an image or provide an image URL to get real-time
recognition results. The application is built with React for the frontend, Express for the backend,
and Multer for handling image uploads. The AI image recognition is powered by the Clarifai API.
